This is a real-time chat application built using React for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. It allows users to sign up, log in, and chat with other users in real time. Firebase handles user authentication and stores chat messages in a cloud database. The app is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and efficient in handling multiple users and conversations at once. This project demonstrates skills in React, Firebase, and front-end web development.
